# Welcome to the Open-Access Sandbox #

The goal of this project is to build reading and searching tools for the scientific literature based around open-access, online content. We have integrated [eLife Lens](https://github.com/elifesciences/lens "eLife Lens") with the open-access portion of the [PubMed Central database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/), and have built a search interface wrapped around PubMed itself. 

To see the tool in action visit [http://www.oa-sandbox.org]([http://www.oa-sandbox.org]).

**Most importantly,** this project is intended as an **experiment** in how the scientific literature can work in a web-connected world. If you have an idea for how to make it better, fork the project and try it. No coding experience? Or open an issue and make your suggestion.
